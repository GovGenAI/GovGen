# GovGen: Decentralized AI Integrity Network for Legal Tech

## Project Description

The Decentralized AI Integrity Network for Legal Tech is an innovative framework designed to ensure the accountability, reliability, and transparency of generative AI outputs within the legal sector. By leveraging blockchain technology, this project aims to provide a robust mechanism for maintaining the integrity of AI-driven decisions, ensuring they adhere to legal standards and are free from bias.

### Motivations

- **Transparency**: To provide a clear audit trail for AI-generated decisions, enhancing trust and accountability in legal contexts.
- **Reliability**: To ensure AI outputs are accurate and compliant with legal standards, reducing the risk of biased or incorrect decisions.
- **Security**: To leverage blockchain's decentralized nature to protect data integrity and prevent manipulation by any single entity.

### Key Components

- **Validators**: Nodes that assess AI-generated outputs for bias, accuracy, and compliance with legal standards.
- **Contributors**: Entities such as law firms, regulatory bodies, and AI developers that provide AI models and datasets.
- **Users**: Legal professionals or other stakeholders who request AI-driven decisions or outputs.
- **Blockchain**: The underlying ledger that records all transactions, validations, and updates, ensuring transparency and tamper-proof records.

### How It Works

1. **Model Submission**: Contributors submit AI models to the network, which are evaluated for quality, accuracy, and bias by validators.
2. **AI Output Validation**: When a user requests an AI-generated output, the output is processed through the networkâ€™s validators.
3. **Incentivization with Tokens**: Validators and contributors are rewarded with native tokens for their contributions.
4. **Immutable Records**: Each validated output and model is stored on the blockchain, ensuring an immutable record for auditability.

### Internet Computer (ICP)

- **Backend Infrastructure**: The Internet Computer hosts the backend infrastructure, including smart contracts that manage task submissions, storage, and retrieval in a decentralized manner.
- **Immutable Records**: Validated outputs and models are stored on the Internet Computer blockchain, ensuring an immutable record that can be audited for bias or discrepancies.

### Bittensor

- **AI Processing**: Bittensor is utilized for AI processing tasks. When a user submits a request, the backend sends the task details to Bittensor for processing.
- **Validation and Incentivization**: Validators in the Bittensor network assess the quality of AI outputs and allocate rewards based on their performance.
- **Customizability**: Validators can be customized to evaluate AI-generated outputs for bias, accuracy, and adherence to legal standards.
